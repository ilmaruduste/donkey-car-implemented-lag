# DonkeyCarImplementedLag

This git repository is meant for implementing lag into the training of a self-driving donkey car's models to test whether lagged models have better performance than regular models.

## Setup

The repo already includes the donkeycar repo, so if you clone this repo, be sure to do it recursively. 

``
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ilmaruduste/DonkeyCarImplementedLag.git
``

You're also going to need to setup a donkey conda environment ([instructions here](https://docs.donkeycar.com/guide/install_software/#step-1-install-software-on-host-pc)).
